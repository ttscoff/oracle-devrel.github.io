# What's Expected of You

Before diving into getting a DevRel repo, here's what we ask (and expect) of you:

* Be polite, kind, and courteous. Treat others the way you want to be treated!
* Don't publish garbage. Do your best to publish only the highest quality content.
* No hit-and-runs. If you publish it, you need to maintain it. This includes monitoring issues, dealing with updates/alerts, etc.
* Ideally there should be two or more maintainers for each repo (project). One person can't do everything (particularly the required code reviews), so having at least two maintainers is a very good idea.
